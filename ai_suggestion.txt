As a quantitative portfolio analyst, I have evaluated the provided metrics for the two momentum strategies.


──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ▶ # PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


The 90-day lookback momentum strategy significantly outperforms the 30-day lookback strategy across all key performance and risk-adjusted metrics.

*   >>> Returns: <<< The 30-day strategy generated a total return of -48.72%, which is substantially worse than the 90-day strategy's total return of -17.94%. This represents a difference of 30.78 percentage points. Similarly, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the 30-day strategy was -20.32%, whereas the 90-day strategy achieved a less severe -6.50% CAGR, a difference of 13.82 percentage points.
*   >>> Risk-Adjusted Metrics: <<< Both strategies exhibit negative risk-adjusted returns, indicating underperformance relative to a risk-free rate. However, the 90-day strategy is considerably less inefficient. Its Sharpe Ratio is -0.20, which is significantly better than the 30-day strategy's Sharpe Ratio of -0.91. The Sortino Ratio also follows this trend, with the 90-day strategy at -0.32 compared to the 30-day strategy's -1.38. These differences highlight the 90-day strategy's superior ability to manage downside risk and generate returns per unit of risk, even in a negative return environment.

  ▶ # RISK VS RETURN ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Both strategies currently reside in an undesirable region of the efficiency frontier, as they deliver negative returns for the risk taken. However, the 90-day strategy is positioned more favorably relative to the 30-day strategy.

*   >>> Efficiency Frontier Positions: <<< The 90-day strategy offers a higher (less negative) CAGR of -6.50% with a volatility of 21.77%. In contrast, the 30-day strategy yields a much lower (more negative) CAGR of -20.32% for a slightly higher volatility of 22.27%. This indicates that the 90-day strategy is more efficient, achieving a better return profile for a comparable level of risk.
*   >>> Drawdown, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratio Trade-offs: <<< The 30-day strategy exhibits a significantly higher maximum drawdown of -55.94%, indicating severe capital impairment. This is substantially worse than the 90-day strategy's maximum drawdown of -25.86%. While the volatility figures are relatively close (22.27% for 30-day vs. 21.77% for 90-day), the 30-day strategy's higher drawdown and much more negative Sharpe Ratio (-0.91 vs. -0.20) demonstrate a poor trade-off between risk and return. The 30-day strategy incurs significantly greater downside risk without commensurate (or even positive) returns.
*   >>> Better Risk-Adjusted Returns: <<< Based on the provided metrics, the >>> 90-day lookback momentum strategy <<< offers demonstrably better risk-adjusted returns. Its higher (less negative) Sharpe and Sortino Ratios, coupled with a significantly lower maximum drawdown for a similar volatility, make it the superior choice between the two, despite both strategies currently showing negative performance.

  ▶ # WHEN EACH STRATEGY OUTPERFORMS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Given the current negative performance of both strategies, "outperforms" should be interpreted as "performs relatively better" or "is less detrimental."

*   >>> 30-day Strategy (Relative Performance): <<< The 30-day strategy's extremely poor performance (e.g., -48.72% total return, -55.94% max drawdown) suggests it is highly susceptible to whipsaws and rapid trend reversals. If it were to "excel" (i.e., perform positively), it would typically be in markets characterized by very strong, persistent, and short-lived trends where assets quickly gain momentum and continue to rise without significant pullbacks. However, the current data indicates it has likely been operating in choppy, volatile, or rapidly reversing markets where short-term signals are unreliable. This strategy is suitable for investors with an extremely high-risk tolerance who are willing to accept substantial drawdowns in pursuit of capturing very short-term, explosive moves.
*   >>> 90-day Strategy (Relative Performance): <<< The 90-day strategy, while still negative, shows significantly more resilience (e.g., -17.94% total return, -25.86% max drawdown). This suggests it performs relatively better in markets with more sustained, medium-term trends, where short-term noise is filtered out. It is less prone to immediate reversals and benefits from more durable price movements. This strategy is suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance who prefer to capitalize on more established trends and are willing to accept moderate drawdowns for potentially more stable (though currently negative) returns than a very short-term approach.

  ▶ # IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


The 30-day strategy is the clear underperformer, primarily due to its high drawdown and very negative risk-adjusted returns.

>>> Proposed Enhancement: <<< Implement a >>> market regime filter based on a longer-term trend indicator. <<<

>>> Explanation: <<< The 30-day strategy's high volatility and severe drawdown suggest it is prone to significant losses during unfavorable market conditions (e.g., bear markets, highly volatile sideways markets). By incorporating a filter, such as requiring the selected assets (or the broader market index) to be above their 200-day simple moving average, the strategy would only initiate or maintain positions during confirmed uptrends. This would prevent the strategy from trading in clearly bearish or highly uncertain market environments.

>>> Impact on Metrics: <<<
*   >>> Max Drawdown: <<< By avoiding significant downturns, the maximum drawdown would likely be substantially reduced from the current -55.94%.
*   >>> Volatility: <<< Trading only in more stable uptrends would decrease the overall volatility from 22.27%.
*   >>> Total Return/CAGR: <<< While it might miss some short-term rallies, avoiding large losses during downtrends would significantly improve the total return and CAGR from their current negative values, potentially pushing them into positive territory.
*   >>> Sharpe/Sortino Ratios: <<< A reduction in drawdown and volatility, coupled with an improvement in returns, would lead to a substantial increase in both the Sharpe Ratio (from -0.91) and Sortino Ratio (from -1.38), making the strategy's risk-adjusted performance much more favorable.
