Here is a concise analysis of the two momentum strategies:

*   >>> Overall Performance: <<< Both momentum strategies generated negative returns and negative risk-adjusted ratios, indicating underperformance across the board.
*   >>> WINNER: <<< Strategy 90-day performs better overall, with a total return of -17.94% and a Sharpe Ratio of -0.20, significantly outperforming Strategy 30-day's -48.72% total return and -0.91 Sharpe Ratio.
*   >>> KEY DIFFERENCE: <<< The most significant performance gap is in Max Drawdown, where Strategy 30-day experienced a -55.94% drawdown, more than double Strategy 90-day's -25.86%.
*   >>> RISK NOTE: <<< The 30-day lookback strategy carries substantially higher downside risk, as indicated by its much larger Max Drawdown and more negative Sortino Ratio (-1.38 vs -0.32).
*   >>> ONE IMPROVEMENT IDEA: <<< Introduce a market regime filter to dynamically adjust exposure or exit positions during periods of unfavorable market conditions, given the consistent negative returns.
